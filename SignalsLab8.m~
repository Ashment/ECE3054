Q:  What is the total transfer function of the system
    above? How many poles does it have?
A:  F(z)=z^(-N)*(K)(0.5+0.5z^(-1))
    H(z)=1/(1-F(z))
    There are N+1 poles.

Q:  Difference Equation for the above system.
A:  Y(Z)(1-K(0.5z^(-N)-0.5^z^(-N-1))) = X(Z)(1)
    y(n) = x(n) + K0.5y(n-N) + K0.5y(n-N-1)

Q:  y=filter(b,a,x). What is a,b.
A:  b=[1, zero(1,N)], a=[0.5, 0.5, zeros(1,N-1)]

%% Implementation

Fs = 8000;
K = 0.98;
N = 100;
L = 7900;

b=[1];
a=[1, zeros(1,N-1), -0.5*K, -0.5*K];

x = [randn(1,N) zeros(1,L)];

Q:  What is N and L if we want 1 second sound?
A:  have signal y with length N+L points. Since we 
    want to sound to last 1 second and are given
    that N=100 and Fs=8000, we have L=7900. Gain 
    value K=0.98 for this example.

Observation: The sound is not the same every time
because of the randn that changes the initial data
point of the input signal.

%% Frequency Response and Periodicity 

Fs = 8000;
K = 0.98;
N = 100;
L = 7900;

b=[1];
a=[1, zeros(1,N-1), -0.5*K, -0.5*K];

x = [randn(1,N) zeros(1,L)];

y = filter(b,a,x);
[H,w] = freqz(b,a,2^16);

soundsc(y,Fs)

% Since the frequency response has consistently spaced
% spikes and attenuates frequencies between those spikes,
% it can be assumed that the output signal would be a
% Relatively simple combination of periodic signals, itself
% nearly a periodic signal of diminishing amplitude.

%% Changing the parameters
%% - Changing K, the Feedback Gain

Fs = 8000;
K = 0.98;
N = 100;
L = 7900;

% Changing the K value changes the speed at which
% amplitude of the signal decreases. Setting K>1 also
% causes the sound to be "reversed". See figure below.

K=1.1;

x = [randn(1,N) zeros(1,L)];
b=[1];
a=[1, zeros(1,N-1), -0.5*K, -0.5*K];

y = filter(b,a,x);

%% - Changing N, the Delay

Fs = 8000;
K = 0.98;
N = 100;
L = 7900;

% Changing the frequency changes the delay time. This
% effectively changes the frequency of the output signal
% and alters the pitch of the sound. Lower N raises the
% frequency and thus the pitch, while increasing N lowers
% the pitch. When frequency is too low, around N-300, the
% frequency is too low and the pitch becomes indescernible.

N=80;

x = [randn(1,N) zeros(1,L)];
b=[1];
a=[1, zeros(1,N-1), -0.5*K, -0.5*K];

y = filter(b,a,x);

%% Changing the Input Signal

Fs = 8000;
K = 0.98;
N = 100;
L = 7900;

b=[1];
a=[1, zeros(1,N-1), -0.5*K, -0.5*K];

x = [1, zeros(1,L)];

soundsc(y,Fs)

% Using the impulse as signal results in a much 
% thinner output signal. The sound of this output
% is much less full and, in my opnion, much less
% realistic in tone.

%% The Comb Filter

%{
A system with only the Gain and Delay is known
as the comb filter.
